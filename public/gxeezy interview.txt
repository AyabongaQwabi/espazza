Okay, Gxeezy this is a casual interview, it's not something professional or formal, so we're going to chat about a couple of things, about you as an entertainer, as an artist, the first question that I have is, how did you come up with the stage name?

Actually, when I started to realize that my brand is getting recognized out there, because at some point, I had a stage name as Bhodloza, right? Me being a Bhodloza, because I always believed that whatever I'm saying is going to make an impact, or Bhodloza is to break something in order for you to be available on that side, or to be able to see what's happening on the other side. So now, from being Bhodloza, and then I feel like, okay, now I did that, and I'm comfortable with it, I feel like now, it's growth, me as a man, my name is Cwenga, and me being Cwenga, it's not enough, right? Because I'm associated with the Xhosa tribe, right? So, being a Xhosa man, you can't be Cwenga as a Xhosa man, right? So, where I come from, as a man, they call you by a surname, by a clan name.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They're going to call you Ntsundu, they're going to call you Ntsundu. If you are Xhosa, you're going to be Xhosa, right? Yeah. So, I'm Gxarha because of, one... Your clan name. My clan name is Gxarha. Mm-hmm. And then secondly, I feel like I'm out there to represent my entire family, tribe, whatever Gxarha's are, you know? I don't know what...

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But the Gxarha thing, you know? The Gxarha thing. The Gxarha clan, yeah. I mean to say clan. I'm out there to... To represent my clan, to leave a mark in order for the next generation to know that there was this Gxarha who has this impact for the clan, right? Mm-hmm. I have a son now. My son, he is fully Gxarha, right? Yeah. Him is Gxarha. Now, he's going to be proud when I'm no more, and he's proud even now, that, okay, me being Gxarha associated with Gxarha.

Mm-hmm.

Does it make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gxarha is... I'm trying to create a generational recognition to make the clan popular, to show what the clan is about. So the music I'm doing right now is associated with the clan, you know what I mean?

So that it lasts for a generation.

And a generation, yeah.

Oh, awesome. Awesome.

Yeah, that's how I started to be Gxarha. And also, to be Gxarha have its own benefits, right? Mm-hmm. So going out there and tell people that you are Gxarha. There's a lot of Gxarha out there, a lot of associates out there. So in order for me to grow, I want to be associated with my blood family, my Gxarha, my clan. Yeah, the one you recognize. You know what I mean? So me being Lil Snaker is the name. There's no root in that. But me being Gxarha has a root, and there's a backup, and there's a full support. There's a proud moment whereby I'm saying, me as Gxarha, I'm trapping a project. Then we as Gxarhas, we have a project out. Mm, nice. So the clan is proud. Everybody's OK. OK. So yeah, I'm part of the clan.

Nice to know that, man. Yeah, man. Who has been, what has been your biggest career highlight as Gxarha?

There's a lot of highlights, right, that I feel like they're big. It's not the only one that I'm going to mention. But the first one, it is was in 2018 In Absa Stadium. Apsa. Absa Stadium in East London. Ooh. That sounds big. Yeah, it was fire. Yeah, yeah. The show was Countdown. OK. From 2018 to 2019. Sure. Right. Yeah. That year, dog, I shared stage with big artists that I wanted to meet. Kwesta was the, Kwesta is my idol, right? Sure. So me meeting Kwesta. Kwesta came to me. It was me and Viva and Siya. Chilling. And then me and Viva and Siya were white, like we're albinos. Right? Sure. So he came and he said, I want to take pictures with you guys. And I was like. That was Kwesta. That was Kwesta, yeah. Yeah. Apsa Stadion. That was big, dog. Yeah, that was big. So I felt so good to be introduced by Putco Mafani on stage. Like, Putco Mafani was like, the next upcoming act is Taka. Sure. You know what I mean? So that was big. Performing with Zuhonge Tikana, performing with Ntando Bangani, performing like with our fellow Xhosa artists mostly, you know. The event was big, I don't want to lie. But me being around those guys on that stage, that big stage whereby we're breaking 2018 to 2019, it's a big platform for you know. So it's a big highlight. And the second one is when I met Emtee, dog.

Emtee? Yeah.

You met Emtee? I met Emtee. What was that?

I'm not sure, 2020, 2019? Yeah. At YOLO Lounge, Queenstown. Queenstown? Yeah. Shout out to DJ 98, he's the one who plugged me. Yeah. So the show was on, and then I was part of the lineup, and then Emtee came to me. So actually, I went to him. True. I said, yo, my name is Taka. I'm an artist. I'm a rock kid. He said, okay, it's fine. He knows what one does that day. We shared the, you know, he signed her. He said, no, it's fine. He said, DM me anytime. What do you mean by a sign, dog? Like, a hand. You shook hands. Oh, okay, okay, okay. You shake hands, yeah. You shake hands, okay. And then, uh, what makes this day big is that 2022 in PE, uh, there was a show, they call,

they say it's, uh, it's Ebu Belen Festival in Gqeberha.

I met Emtee there. Again? Again. When I met him, he said, you know, I know that nigga. Oh, really? And I was like, yeah, what up, Kutma? Yeah. I'm good. I'm good. And I gave him my C. Oh, yeah, yeah. He was going along with Ulo the Native. When was that? I think it was 2022 December. Oh, jeez. During festive season. 2022 December, 2021 December. So, when that, when that happened, the nigga said to me, said, no, I know this nigga, you know, because I tried to introduce myself. And then he said, no, I know this nigga. I don't know where I met him. And I'm like, yeah, Queenstown. I'm like, oh, yeah, I remember. I remember. Then it felt so good that, at least Emtee. Because I'm aware that I'm doing this thing. You know what I mean? Because he's one of my idols. The time he dropped Roll Up, the time he rolled Washa Washa, I was so inspired by the wave. The wave. And the move, you know?

Yeah.

So, now, if now, today, you recognize me, it's one of the iconic moments of my life in this music industry. You know what I mean?

All right.

You want the last one?

No, no, no. No, the last one is fine. I would like the last one. Let me give you the last one. Okay, okay.

The last one, I met Flaba. Flaba? Yeah. Flabolicious? Flaba. May he so rest in peace. Yay! Flaba, the Skoda Cam guy. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I met Flaba in 2011. Hmm. I was young. What was that? Yeah, in Alexandra. Litsabong. There's a club in Alexandra. Oh, nice. Yeah, Litsabong. My producer, when I did the song, that guy introduced me to Flaba. Flaba was there, and I was like, he saw me performing. And Flaba came to me and said, yo, that was fire. Why are you staying? That's what I'm saying. And he said, damn, bro, what you doing there? You're supposed to be here. You know? Yeah. And then I felt like, you know what? I have to pursue with this career. Because now, at least Flaba is certifying me. You know what I mean? And then now, he was so proud of me. The energy. I was so young. Yeah. I felt so good. Yeah, man. Shout out to those three moments. They made me this artist that I am today.

That you are today. Yeah. That's some powerful words. Shut up. That's some powerful words.

Shut up.

Shut up. I want to ask, what inspired you to start making music?

At home, I used to play gospel. I used to play kwaito. Okay. At home, it's my grandmother. It's my aunt, which is ooMakazi. And then my hot man as well. My older brothers. You know? Yeah. Each and every person, they used to play their own different music. My older brothers, they used to play kwaito. And my aunts, they used to play R&B and Afropop. And then my old lady, my grandmother, used to play gospel.

You know?

So, growing up in that environment, whereby I'm trying to find myself, which one I love the most. Because the family loves music. And then when I'm new, I don't know what to love. Then I fell in love with music. Because they used to play music every day. Different. They used to play Riki, kwaito, R&B, gospel. All of the songs. All of the songs. Mostly. Mostly. And jazz as well. Okay. And then now, time went on. I found out that I can't sing properly. You know? Mm. They used to sing gospel songs, melodies and shit. So, they used to kill that. Now, when I'm finding myself doing that, I used to fail to sing, to get the pitches, the hila. They say, yeah, you lost it. Yeah. Yeah. So, sitting with them, doing music in front of me for the longest time. But then it's when I got influenced by kwaito.

Mm.

And then, my Grootman, Grootman used to date my aunt. He used to come with a CD called Brickz. There's a Brickz CD. Sure.

2005.

Sure. The album is Face Brick. Right? Mm. He pulled up with it. The album had a song underpinned. That was my favorite song from the album. For real?

Yeah.

So, the song influenced me to write my own lines. Yeah. So, from loving Zola, loving Thebe, loving Arthur, and loving Mzambiya. Yeah, and all those guys. But when Brickz pulled through, and then I fell in love with Brickz a lot. I love the energy. I love how, like, he's fluent. I feel like one day DJ Cleo is going to sign me. I had that. I grabbed that. Yeah. They know my niggas, like, all the time. DJ Cleo is going to sign me.

But DJ Cleo is not so far until these days. He's not so far.

Yeah.

Why don't you approach him?

Yeah. I want to be fit enough. Okay. I want to be fit enough. Because in Johannesburg, I realized that they have their own expectations. In order for me to fit in on his table, I have to be a certain person and to do things differently and all of that. But for now, I'm not focusing more on being signed by DJ Cleo anymore. I'm focusing more on building my own brand in order for me to collaborate with DJ Cleo as a businessman. Nice.

Yeah.

So, he's one of the inspirations. And, yeah, man. What was the question?

No. It's this. Awesome, dude. Oh, yeah. This is my next question. My next question is, what challenges have you faced in building your musical presence? And can you tell us a little bit about that? Have you faced any challenges in cementifying yourself as Gxarha the brand? On the social media networks. Okay. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Have you faced any challenges with that? Or was it all a breeze to you?

No. The challenge that I'm facing every day is the challenge that I took, is the risk that I took. You know? Mm. Cape Town hip-hop scene influenced me to be a rapper, right? Because from understanding the music, Kwaito and all of that, from home, I fell in love with the Cape Town hip-hop scene. Kideo inspired me. Phizo inspired me. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Phizo. Three Months Cup inspired me. Sure. Right. So, that sound, it's not easy to sell it.

Mm. Right. And why is that?

You asking now, or are you going to ask me now?

I'm curious. Why is that? Why is it easy to sell?

The sound sound called Spaza is like premature, right? It sounds premature. I feel like it needs more engineers, more departments to make it popular, right? Yeah. Because if you talk about jazz, you'd see that there are departments within the genre. Yeah. Yeah. These people, they need to show that the sound sounds professional. The sound is presented well. The sound is being published to the right people. The sound is on TV. The sound is on radio. So, what I'm saying, the spars are sound is premature. I mean, it's because, one, after recording the music, it's up to you what you're going to do with the music.

They can release it then and there.

You can drop it anyhow. Somebody can drop it. Yeah. It can leak. There's no order in order for the music. There's no respect for the music at the moment. Yeah. There's no respect. Because, one, what are you going to do with it? If you're recording this music here, you're telling the guy that, how much is the recording session? He's going to say 300. Wait, wait, wait.

Are you saying that's what's happening now?

It's the challenge that I'm facing.

Okay. The challenge that I'm facing now, the sound that I'm doing right now, it's hard for it to penetrate because there are no departments to support the sound to be in a space whereby it's supposed to be here. Okay. You know what I mean? Like, we have big artists. Shout out to Bravo Le Roux. Bravo Le Roux is breaking boundaries now. Yeah. He's making the sound more fashionable. Right? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The Spaza sound had no fashion.

Yeah, exactly.

Bravo is bringing it. The Spaza sound didn't go outside the borders most of the time. Driemanskap did. Now it's Bravo, right? And Bravo is making it like a norm now. Like, he's going outside all the time. He feels like doing it. So now he's doing it well for the sound, right? So, when I'm saying that I'm facing this challenge, this sound that I'm in is still under development. It's still growing. It's still growing. If I join the sound whereby it's over the top, it's still growing. I'm already there. I should have been gone. Now, not anybody want to listen to me if I say I'm a rapper. It's a course. Right? Yeah.

You know what I mean? I would understand. Yeah.

Whoever did this thing that we are doing, that's the question I'm getting from people. I'm saying, I'm going to make this thing possible. So now, I'm in a struggle. I'm joining a fighting army to make the sound better instead of joining a better sound to

beat.

So, my bread is not here yet. My bread is there. I'm supposed to work hard. I'm supposed to work hard in order for me to get that bread. You know what I mean? That's what I'm talking about. So, the sound is the challenge that I'm facing. I'm doing a sound that is not easy to sell.

Most definitely.

Secondly, I'm doing a sound that it hasn't found itself yet.

It's still searching.

It's still searching. Okay. What I'm talking about. That I'm talking about. There are no mafias for the sound. There are no gatekeepers for the sound. There are no, uh, there People who are responsible for PR for the sound. There's no support for the sound. People, they feel pity for us because they see the energy that we're putting in. They see the time that we're spending to make this thing work. And they feel like there's a need for them to support us. At the end of the day, at the peak of their minds, they feel like we're doing nonsense.

Yeah?

Yeah, a lot of people, they feel like we're doing... Think about it. Isn't that discouraging? It is. That's why you're going to say I'm strong because I'm here with the sound, even though it's discouraging.

Yeah. Yeah.

So now I'm trying to find myself as an artist and have something that is going to be solid. Okay, my MaXhosa once said on one of his interviews that... Okay.

So what I'm trying to say is this interview... I flipped. Ah.

Okay. Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

Yeah, but what I'm trying to say is the sound, in order for us to overcome this challenge that I'm facing right now as a sound, here's the trick. Let's make music that's going to be sellable. Let's not expect our fans to feel pity for us in order for our music to grow. Okay. See, now we're depending on them to feel pity and feel shame and feel... Sorry for us because we're doing this music that is not sellable. It means that it's a calling for us. Yo, guys, you need to follow the right procedures, do the right things in order for the music to be more appealing. The music can be played on radio. The music can be on TV. Meet the quality standards. There's a lot of responsibilities. Exactly.

Yeah.

So we don't have mentors. We don't have people who's going to tell us that we're doing it right or not. We're doing it in our own. So the old good mans, they don't want to quit. They don't want to quit the music and do the admin and the leadership moves for the music. Instead, they still rap with us. So now I'm looking for bigger artists. The older artists, the ones that are doing it before us, now they're supposed to be mafias for the sound. Yeah. They're supposed to open the doors for us. Yeah. That's how it is.

All right. You heard it. Yeah. Xhosa Hip Hop. Easy. All right. Gxeezy.

All right.
Thank you for sharing your journey and insights with us. It's been a pleasure to learn more about you as Gxarha and the challenges you're facing in the music industry.
